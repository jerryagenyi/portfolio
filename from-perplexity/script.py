From enhancing public health campaigns to building engaging WordPress-powered platforms, I bring technical expertise and creative problem-solving to every project.\n\nMy journey has led me to embrace emerging technologies like automation tools (n8n), AI, and modern web development frameworks like Next.js. As a lifelong learner, I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in programming (JavaScript, Python) and UI/UX design to deliver user-centric solutions. My work is guided by a strong commitment to social goodâ€”using technology to empower communities and foster inclusion.\n\nWhether leading a 32-member technical team or mentoring students, I thrive on collaboration and innovation. I'm excited to connect with professionals who share my enthusiasm for combining technology and creativity to make a meaningful impact.",

Over the past 12+ years, I've had the privilege of working on projects that matter: from leading COVID-19 communications for Nigeria's Centre for Disease Control to serving as an Atlas Corps Fellow at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights in Washington, DC.\n\nMy work has spanned public health campaigns, WordPress development, digital marketing strategy, and now product management. I've led a 32-member team during a global pandemic, built websites for nonprofits driving change, and helped international organizations communicate life-saving information to millions.\n\nToday, as a co-founder of Balance Platform alongside Kelvin Bawa, Maria Raiwe, and Gloria Osemeke, I'm building solutions that combine AI, ethical automation, and accessible technology to serve communitiesâ€”from church management systems to public health tools.\n\nI believe technology should empower, not exclude. Whether I'm coding in JavaScript and Python, designing user experiences, or crafting communication strategies, my focus remains constant: creating digital solutions that make a real difference in people's lives."
