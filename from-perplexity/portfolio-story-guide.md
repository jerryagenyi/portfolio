## Key Storytelling Principles for Your Portfolio

### 1. **Lead with Your "Why"**

**Opening Hook:** Don't start with "I'm a product manager." Start with your purpose.

**Suggested Hero Section:**
> "I build digital solutions for social impact."
> 
> I'm a product manager and full-stack developer who believes technology should empower, not exclude. With over a decade bridging communication, technology, and social good, I help organizations leverage digital transformation to serve communities that need it most.

### 2. **The Power of Contrast**

Your story gains strength from unexpected pivots:
- **Geology → Technology**: From studying earth systems to building digital systems
- **Nigeria → Global**: From local impact to international fellowships and World Bank projects
- **Crisis → Clarity**: COVID-19 chaos led to career clarity (product management)
- **Corporate → Startup**: From leading large teams to co-founding your own platform

**Use these contrasts** to show adaptability and intentional growth.

### 3. **Quantify Your Impact**

You have impressive metrics—use them:
- Led **32-member team** during pandemic response
- **12+ years** of experience at technology-communication-social impact intersection
- Worked across **multiple West African countries** on health security
- Co-founded **Social Good Nigeria** in 2014 (still active)
- Served among **23 Global Superheroes** selected for Atlas Corps

### 4. **Show the "Aha!" Moment**

Your LinkedIn article about discovering product management during COVID-19 is gold. Use it:

> "During the COVID-19 pandemic, while orchestrating Nigeria's public health response, I had an epiphany: I was already doing product management. I was the bridge between scientists defining challenges and technologists building solutions—speaking both languages fluently. That realization gave my diverse journey a coherent narrative."

### 5. **Feature Your Multidisciplinary Superpower**

Your unique value is **integration**:
- You code (JavaScript, Python, Next.js)
- You design (UI/UX, branding)
- You communicate (led national PR during pandemic)
- You strategize (World Bank consulting, media strategies)
- You build (WordPress platforms, automation workflows)

**Frame this as**: "I don't just manage products—I can build them, design them, market them, and communicate their value."

## Storytelling Tips by Section

### 1. **About Section: Make It Personal**

**Don't say**: "I'm a communications professional with experience in..."

**Do say**: "My journey from geology to digital product management has been anything but linear—and that's what makes it powerful."

**Include**:
- The "why" behind your transition from geology
- Your lightbulb moment during COVID-19
- Your philosophy about technology and social impact
- What drives you (empowering communities, not just building products)

### 2. **Experience Section: Focus on Impact**

For each role, use this structure:
- **What you did** (role, company, dates)
- **Why it mattered** (the challenge or opportunity)
- **How you delivered** (your approach)
- **What changed** (measurable outcomes)

**Example (NCDC)**:
> "Led corporate communications for Nigeria's national public health institute during one of the most critical periods in global health history. Managed a 32-member team during the COVID-19 pandemic, coordinating messaging that reached millions of Nigerians. Grew NCDC's digital presence significantly while establishing partnerships with international health organizations including UK's Public Health England and Germany's Robert Koch Institute. This experience revealed my calling: I was already doing product management—bridging scientific expertise and technical implementation."

### 3. **Projects Section: Show Range**

- **Current Innovation**: Balance Platform (AI, automation, social impact)
- **Community Building**: Social Good Nigeria (long-term commitment)
- **Technical Execution**: WordPress platforms (hands-on skills)
- **Campaign Success**: Public health campaigns (measurable impact)

For each project, answer:
- What problem did this solve?
- Who did it help?
- What did you build/create?
- What was the outcome?

### 4. **Contact Section: Make It Personal**

**Don't say**: "Feel free to contact me."

**Do say**:

## Closing Thoughts

Your story is powerful because it's authentic. You're not a developer who learned some business skills or a business person who dabbles in code. You're a true hybrid who discovered—through lived experience in some of the highest-stakes environments possible—that you're at your best bridging worlds.

The geology background isn't a detour—it shows intellectual curiosity and adaptability. The Atlas Corps Fellowship isn't just a line item—it's proof of global recognition. The COVID-19 work isn't just a job—it's where you discovered your calling. Balance Platform isn't just a startup—it's the synthesis of everything you've learned about using technology to serve communities.

Tell that story. Own it. The right opportunities will find you.
